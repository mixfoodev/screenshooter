This is a small C# Windows Forms application that can be used to take screenshots of a portion of your screen.

**How it works**

- It needs two points of the screen to form a rectangle.
- That rectangle is used to take the screenshot.

**How to use**

- Imagine a rectangle on the screen you want to capture.
- Point your cursor to the top/left corner and press 'Start/Stop' key.
- Point your cursor to the bottom/right corner and press 'Start/Stop' key again.
- In this stage the screenshot has been captured. You can press 'save' key to save it or 'Shift + Save key' to save it and show it in folder.
- You can press the 'Esc' key to cancel the capture or remove screenshots that have been taken but not saved.

The app can also run while is minimized to tray.

_**NOTE:** It doesn't matter if the first point is top/right as long as the two points form a rectangle._  
_For example first point could be bottom/left and second point top/right etc._
